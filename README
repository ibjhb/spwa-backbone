spwa-backbone is a script written to demonstrate the power of Backbone.js and also provide a simple and quick way
to make single page web applications.  You could certainly use this script by itself to make quick webpages but 
most 'applications' are going to have additional code.

To create additional 'pages', just duplicate the script block, make sure the id is 'PAGENAME-template' (where you put your own pagename)
and then link to the page using a similar convention to the menu above.  The script will automatically load all the 'pages' into Backbone.js
and watch for hashtag changes.  The only required page is the home-template page, so the application has a 'default'.
